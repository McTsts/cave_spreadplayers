# cave_spreadplayers
A spreadplayers utility that is made to spread players into caves and structures

This is a pack to place a player in a structure, like a cave. In the overworld this will generally place you under a tree, or error out after too many attempts, but in the nether or a cave world, this can effectively be a spreadplayers command.

This is effectively obsolete with the new spreaplayers functionality, but there are a few niche use cases where this may be relevant.

To run use the function `cavespread:spread`

This will only place a player on "valid" blocks, these are under the tag `#cavespread:valid` you can add or remove blocks as you see fit.

To get debug info just do add the tag `csdebug` to yourself
